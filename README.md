# Trailhead Challenge App
The Trailhead Challenge was an event hosted by the Student Group UADY where participants from Mexico and US had to make the most points in the Salesforce learning platform: Trailhead. This project was a scoring board site demo connected with OAuth to a Salesforce App in order to retrieve the data of the participants (score, name) from the Org.
